## Marlin 1.1.x latest for Raise3D N-series printers

Setup copy for Raise3D N2 Plus Dual. Installable via the screen. 

BL Touch mount available here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1903054

Z-Offset needs to be set in EEPROM. Either via SSH to the screen, or plugged in directly to the board. Not 100% if setting it via the gcode actually works.

## I can in no way guarantee it to work, nor am I responsible if anything goes wrong. This is configured specifically for the mount in the thingiverse link.



## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](https://github.com/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
